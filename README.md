# Welcome to the e2e Testing Meetup

## Setup instructions

In advance of the meetup event please have the following installed:

## Install Git

This can be a bit different depending on your OS but a good resource is [git-scm](http://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Install Node.js

Files and instructions can be found on the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Install CasperJS and PhantomJS

Open a terminal and enter:
```
$ npm install -g casperjs phantomjs
```

Confirm PhantomJS and CasperJS are installed on your machine; you should be able to get the following:

```
$ phantomjs --version
1.8.2
$ casperjs --version
CasperJS version 1.1.0-DEV at /Users/username/Sites/casperjs, using phantomjs version 1.9.2
...
```

Note: You may also wish to install SlimerJS (npm install -g slimerjs) however it is rather large and will take a while.
You may wish to use it after our workshop (however it is not critical to have for what we will cover, it's a nice to have,
and we will discuss its use.  BEWARE you need to download it with a speedy internet connection!
